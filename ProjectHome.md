<h2>New Site</h2>
Check out the new site at [mecwerks.com](http://mecwerks.com) for coding tutorials, and news updates.
<br>
<br>
<b>Mecwerks</b> is a modified version of the <a href='http://code.google.com/p/ioq3ztm/'>Spearmint Engine</a> also used by <a href='http://code.google.com/p/ioid3/'>ioid3</a> and <a href='http://code.google.com/p/turtlearena/'>Turtle Arena</a>. This project is a standalone game and does not run as a mod from ioquake3/Spearmint and does not play normal ioquake3 mods. Spearmint itself is built off of ioquake3. Compatibility is broken so tons of enhancements can be done. A major new feature is 4 player split-screen!<br>
<br>
Note: Mecwerks development has moved to github ( <a href='https://github.com/mecwerks/mecwerks'>https://github.com/mecwerks/mecwerks</a> ) following Spearmint and ioquake3. The issue tracker will be moved as well.<br>
